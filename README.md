# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_on_Drone_Data
This project is aimed to develop a big data processing system design accompanied with proof of concepts to meet the business requirements of a giant banking partner. The design involved proposing accurate big data components in line with the company requirements and associated costs.
#### Developer Name: Arunava Munshi
#### Developed On: Python 3 and Jupyter notebook
#### Libraries used: 
* String (for String Processng)
* nltk - natural language toolkit (tokenizer, lemmatizer, stopwords, collocations and probabilities)
* re (for regular expression, included in Anaconda Python 2.7) 
* itertools (for iterations)
* collections (for Collocations)
### Project Briefing
This project is regarding d exploratort data analysis andata cleansing. So, here the primary aim is to find and fix incorrect and missing data in the dataset and do proper imputation into them. After, data cleasing and imputation, proper insigts is expected through sophisticated ML technique.
#### Input Files: 
raw_data.csv
#### Output files:
Final_Cleaned_Data.csv
#### Learning:
Finding different data issues such as missing values, duplicate data, incorrect data etc. and fixing or cleaning them; Finding relations and dependencies among different data columns; Using Machine Learning techniques such as Regression, K-Means, K-Nearest Neighbors in Python to generate insights; Exploratory Data Analysis in Python.
